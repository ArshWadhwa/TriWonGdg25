AI Medical Doctor is a cutting-edge, full-stack medical consultation platform that leverages advanced AI to provide instant analysis of medical images and voice-recorded symptoms. Users can upload various medical images—from X-rays to skin conditions—or simply describe their symptoms aloud to receive a detailed preliminary assessment. The platform integrates Groq's Llama 4 Scout for nuanced image analysis and Whisper Large V3 for highly accurate speech-to-text transcription. The AI-generated insights are structured professionally, offering differential diagnoses and relevant ICD-10 medical codes to bridge the gap between patient concerns and clinical data. For a complete, accessible experience, the AI's response is converted into natural-sounding speech using ElevenLabs, with a reliable Google TTS fallback.

Built on a modern and robust technology stack, the application ensures a seamless and professional user experience. The frontend is powered by React 19 and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and mobile-first interface featuring medical-themed UI and glassmorphism effects. The backend is a high-performance FastAPI server, built with asynchronous support to handle concurrent requests efficiently. The modular architecture separates concerns, with dedicated Python modules for AI analysis, voice processing, and text-to-speech generation. This powerful combination of technologies delivers a secure, scalable, and intuitive tool designed for preliminary medical exploration, empowering users with immediate, AI-driven insights.
